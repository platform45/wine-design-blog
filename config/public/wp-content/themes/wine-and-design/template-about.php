              What started out as the designers from Platform45 wanting to host an event like our developers host Ruby on Beer and Code & Coffee, has become the very successful, Wine & Design; a monthly gathering of talented SA designers striving towards design driven change.
            </p>
            <p>
              The events take place in the creative hubs of Johannesburg, each month introducing a new, established designer as guest speaker and a local winery offering tastings and opportunity to buy wine at cellar prices.
            </p>
            <p>
              Being a software development company, Platform45 values design as an essential, powerful tool that is ultimately what determines the user experience. Design has the power to change the world. Wine & Design is about networking and driving that change.
            </p>

            <p>
              Each Wine & Design sees a new theme to which tastings from top local wineries are prepared accordingly e.g. Champagne, Red, Organic etc. After being inspired from engaging guest speeches, and with a glass of wine in hand, our guests are encouraged to mingle and network while having a bite.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wine & Design is the bringing together of brilliant people, bright ideas and beautiful food and wine…
